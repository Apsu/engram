# Arno's Engram keyboard layout

Engram is a key layout optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English 
created by [Arno Klein](https://binarybottle.com), 
with [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram) to create other optimized key layouts.
Soon you will be able to install the Engram layout on [Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://keyman.com/keyboards/engram)
or [try it out online](https://keymanweb.com/#en,Keyboard_engram) -- currently a pull request is under review by the Keyman community.
An article is under review (see the [preprint](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0287/v1) for an earlier description and preliminary layout).

Letters are optimally arranged according to ergonomics factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and more efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs. The most common punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (shown as pairs of default and Shift-key-accessed characters). See below for a full description and comparisons with other key layouts.

## Why a new key layout? <a name="why">

**Personal history** <br>
In the future, I hope to include an engaging rationale for why I took on this challenge.
Suffice to say I love solving problems, and I have battled repetitive strain injury 
ever since I worked on an old DEC workstation at the MIT Media Lab while composing 
my thesis back in the 1990s.
I have experimented with a wide variety of human interface technologies over the years --
voice dictation, one-handed keyboard, keyless keyboard, foot mouse, and ergonomic keyboards 
like the Kinesis Advantage and [Ergodox](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/APXBR/latest/0) keyboards with different key switches.
While these technologies can significantly improve comfort and reduce strain, 
an optimized key layout can only help when typing on ergonomic or standard keyboards. 

I have used different key layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, etc.)
for communications and for writing and programming projects,
and have primarily relied on Colemak for the last 10 years. 
**I find that most to all of these key layouts:**

- Demand too much strain on tendons
    - *strenuous lateral extension of the index and little fingers*
- Ignore the ergonomics of the human hand
    - *different finger strengths*
    - *different finger lengths*
    - *natural roundedness of the hand*
    - *home row easier than upper row for shorter fingers*
    - *home row easier than lower row for longer fingers*
    - *ease of little-to-index finger rolls vs. reverse*
- Over-emphasize alternation between hands and under-emphasize same-hand, different-finger transitions
    - *same-row, adjacent finger transitions are easy and comfortable*
    - *little-to-index finger rolls are easy and comfortable*

While I used ergonomic principles outlined below and the accompanying code to help generate the Engram layout,
I also relied on massive bigram frequency data for the English language. 
if one were to follow the procedure below and use a different set of bigram frequencies for another language or text corpus,
they could create a variant of the Engram layout, say "Engram-French", better suited to the French language.
    
**Why "Engram"?** <br>
The name is a pun, referring both to "n-gram", letter permutations and their frequencies that are used to compute the Engram layout, and "engram", or memory trace, the postulated change in neural tissue to account for the persistence of memory, as a nod to my attempt to make this layout easy to remember.

## How does Engram compare with other key layouts? <a name="scores">

Despite the fact that the Engram layout was designed to reduce strain and discomfort, not specifically to increase speed or reduce finger travel from the home row, it scores higher than all other key layouts (Colemak, Dvorak, QWERTY, etc.) for some large, representative, publicly available data (all text sources are listed below and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/binarybottle/text_data)). Below are tables of different prominent key layouts scored using the Engram Scoring Model (detailed below), and generated by the online [Keyboard Layout Analyzer](http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer/) (KLA):

> The optimal layout score is based on a weighted calculation that factors in the distance your fingers moved (33%), how often you use particular fingers (33%), and how often you switch fingers and hands while typing (34%).

## Guiding criteria   <a name="criteria">

    1.  Assign letters to keys that don't require lateral finger movements.
    2.  Promote alternating between hands over uncomfortable same-hand transitions.
    3.  Assign the most common letters to the most comfortable keys.
    4.  Arrange letters so that more frequent bigrams are easier to type.
    5.  Promote little-to-index-finger roll-ins over index-to-little-finger roll-outs.
    6.  Balance finger loads according to their relative strength.
    7.  Avoid stretching shorter fingers up and longer fingers down.
    8.  Avoid using the same finger.
    9.  Avoid skipping over the home row.
    10. Assign the most common punctuation to keys in the middle of the keyboard.
    11. Assign easy-to-remember symbols to the Shift-number keys.
    
### Factors used to compute the Engram layout <a name="factors">
  - **N-gram letter frequencies** <br>
    
    [Peter Norvig's analysis](http://www.norvig.com/mayzner.html) of data from Google's book scanning project
  - **Flow factors** (transitions between ordered key pairs) <br>
    These factors are influenced by Dvorak's 11 criteria (1936).
    
## Summary of steps and results  <a name="summary">

### Step 1: Define the shape of the key layout to minimize lateral finger movements

We will assign 24 letters to 8 columns of keys separated by two middle columns reserved for punctuation. These 8 columns require no lateral finger movements when touch typing, since there is one column per finger. The most comfortable keys include the left and right home rows (keys 5-8 and 17-20), the top-center keys (2,3 and 14,15) that allow the longer middle and ring fingers to uncurl upwards, as well as the bottom corner keys (9,12 and 21,24) that allow the shorter fingers to curl downwards. We will assign the two least frequent letters, Z and Q, to the two hardest-to-reach keys lying outside the 24-key columns in the upper right:

        Left:            Right:
     1  2  3  4       13 14 15 16  Z/Q
     5  6  7  8       17 18 19 20  Q/Z
     9 10 11 12       21 22 23 24

### Step 2: Arrange the most frequent letters based on comfort, their frequencies, and bigram frequencies

We will assign letters to keys by choosing the arrangement with the highest score according to our scoring model. However, there are over four hundred septillion, or four hundred trillion trillion (26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000, or 4.032914611 E+26) possible arrangements of 26 letters (24! = 6.204484017 E+23), so we will arrange the letters in stages, based on ergonomics principles.
    
In prior experiments using the methods below, all vowels consistently automatically clustered together. Below, we will arrange vowels on one side and the most frequent consonants to the other side to encourage balance and alternation across hands. Since aside from the letters Z and Q there is symmetry across left and right sides, we will decide later which side the vowels and which side the most frequent consonants should go.

#### Vowels
    
**E**, T, **A, O, I**, N, S, R, H, L, D, C, **U**, M, F, P, G, W, **Y**, B, V, K, X, J, Q, Z

The high-frequency bigrams that contain these vowels are listed below in bold, with more than 10 billion instances:

**OU, IO, EA, IE**, AI, IA, EI, UE, UA, AU, UI, OI, EO, OA, OE 
    
     OU  24531132241
     IO  23542263265
     EA  19403941063
     IE  10845731320
     AI   8922759715
     IA   8072199471   
     EI   5169898489
     UE   4158448570       
     UA   3844138094   
     AU   3356322923
     UI   2852182384
     OI   2474275212
     EO   2044268477
     OA   1620913259
     OE   1089254517 
   
We will assign the vowels (E,A,O,I,U) to the most comfortable keys (keys 5-8, 2-3, and also 4 or 12 for the letter U) on one side, with the letter E, the most frequent in the English language, assigned to either of the strongest keys (7 and 8, the middle and index fingers on the left home row). We will arrange the vowels such that any top-frequency bigram (more than 1 billion instances in Peter Norvig's analysis of Google data) reads from left to right (ex: EA, not AE) for ease of typing (roll-in from little to index finger vs. roll-out from index to little finger). These constraints lead to 8 comfortable and efficient layouts:
   
    - - U -    - - - -    - O U -    - O - -    - - O -    - - O -    
    I O E A    I O E A    I - E A    I - E A    I - E A    - I E A    
    - - - -    - - - U    - - - -    - - - U    - - - U    - - - U
    
    - O - U    - - O U
    I - E A    - I E A    
    - - - -    - - - -    

#### Consonants

To maximize the number of bigrams we can comfortably type on the home row for the other hand, we consider all consonants (T, N, S, R, H, D, C) within the highest frequency bigrams (at least 10 billion instances in Norvig's analysis: TH, ND, ST, NT, CH, NS, CT, TR, RS, NC, RT, where below 10 billion instances these bigrams start to occur in reverse, such as RT and TS): 
    
     TH 100,272,945,963  3.56% 
     ND  38,129,777,631  1.35%
     ST  29,704,461,829  1.05%
     NT  29,359,771,944  1.04%
     CH  16,854,985,236  0.60%

Of all possible 4-consonant sequences containing four of the seven consonants, we select those sequences that contain the highest possible number (5 or 6) of high-frequency bigrams (at least one billion instances in Norvig's analysis: TH, ND, ST, NT, CH, NS, CT, TR, RS, NC, RT, SH, LD, RD, LS, DS, LT, TL, RL, HR, NL, and SL). The resulting sequences and their bigrams are:

    RNST: RN, RS, RT, NS, NT, ST    
    NRST: NS, NT, RS, RT, ST    
    RSNT: RS, RN, RT, ST, NT   
    RSTH: RS, RT, ST, SH, TH   
    NSTH: NS, NT, ST, SH, TH    
    NCTH: NC, NT, CT, CH, TH 
    
The resulting eight arrangements of five vowels on the left and six sequences of four consonants on the right gives us 48 initial layouts, each with 15 unassigned keys. Below, the three rows on the left and right side of the keyboard are represented as a linear string of letters, with unassigned keys denoted by “-”. All sequences on the right side will be reversed so that they read from right to left for ease of typing (right-hand roll-in from little to index finger vs. roll-out from index to little finger):

### Step 3: Optimize assignment of the remaining letters
    
We want to assign letters to the 15 unassigned keys in each of the above 36 layouts based on our scoring model. That would mean scoring all possible arrangements for each layout and choosing the arrangement with the highest score, but since there are over 1.3 trillion (15!) possible ways of arranging 15 letters, we will break up the assignment into two stages for the most frequent and least frequent remaining letters. 
    
#### **Engram Scoring Model**
    
The optimization algorithm finds every permutation of a given set of letters, maps these letter permutations to a set of keys, and ranks these letter-key mappings according to a score reflecting ease of typing key pairs and frequency of letter pairs (bigrams). The score is the average of the scores for all possible bigrams in this arrangement. The score for each bigram is a product of the frequency of occurrence of that bigram, the frequency of each of the bigram’s characters, and flow, strength (and optional speed) factors for the key pair.
    
#### Flow factors to penalize strenuous key transitions

Direction:
    
    - outward = 0.9
        - outward roll of fingers from the index to little finger

Dexterity:
    
    - side_above_3away = 0.9
        - index and little finger type two keys, one or more rows apart
    - side_above_2away = 0.9^2 = 0.81
        - index finger types key a row or two above ring finger key, or
        - little finger types key a row or two above middle finger key
    - side_above_1away = 0.9^3 = 0.729
        - index finger types key a row or two above middle finger key, or
        - little finger types key a row or two above ring finger key
    - middle_above_ring = 0.9
        - middle finger types key a row or two above ring finger key
    - ring_above_middle = 0.9^3 = 0.729
        - ring finger types key a row or two above middle finger key
    - lateral = 0.9
        - lateral movement of (index or little) finger outside of 8 vertical columns
        - always accompanied by same_finger parameter
    
Distance:
    
    - skip_row_3away = 0.9       
        - index and little fingers type two keys that skip over home row 
        - (e.g., one on bottom row, the other on top row)
    - skip_row_2away = 0.9^3 = 0.729
        - little and middle or index and ring fingers type two keys that skip over home row
    - skip_row_1away = 0.9^5 = 0.59049
        - little and ring or middle and index fingers type two keys that skip over home row

Repetition:
 
    - skip_row_0away = 0.9^4 = 0.6561
        - same finger types two keys that skip over home row
    - same_finger = 0.9^5 = 0.59049
        - use same finger again for a different key
        - cannot accompany outward, side_above, or adjacent_shorter_above 

Strength: Accounted for by the strength matrix (minimum value for the little finger = 0.95)
   
### Most frequent letters
For six of the eight vowel arrangements, we will compute scores for every possible arrangement of all but the least frequent 6 remaining letters (aside from Z and Q, in bold below), assigned to all but the least comfortable 6 keys. The least comfortable keys are assumed to be the corner keys accessed by the little fingers and the top corner keys accessed by the index fingers.

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, **R, H, L, D, C**, U, **M, F, P, G, W**, Y, B, V, K, X, J, Q, Z

       Hand 1:          Hand 2:
     -  2  3  -        - 14 15  -
     x  x  x  x        x  x  x  x
     - 10 11 12       21 22 23  -
    
Since there are 9! = 362,880 combinations for 36 layouts, we need to score and evaluate 13,063,680 combinations.  

For the remaining two vowel arrangements with U in the upper right corner, we will compute scores for every possible arrangement of 8 unassigned keys (covering all but 7 of the 8 corner keys).

       Hand 1:          Hand 2:
     -  x  3  x        - 14 15  -
     x  x  7  x        x  x  x  x
     - 10 11  -        - 22 23  -

     -  O  -  U
     I  -  E  A    
     -  -  -  -    

       Hand 1:          Hand 2:
     -  2  x  x        - 14 15  -
     5  x  x  x        x  x  x  x
     - 10 11  -        - 22 23  -

     -  -  O  U
     -  I  E  A    
     -  -  -  -    

Since there are 8! = 40,320 possible combinations for 12 layouts combinations for each layout, we need to score and evaluate 13,063,680 more combinations.  
    
To score each arrangement of letters, we construct a frequency matrix where we multiply a matrix containing the frequency of each ordered pair of letters (bigram) by our flow and strength matrices to compute a score.      

### Least frequent letters
Next we will compute scores for every possible arrangement of the least frequent 7 or 8 letters besides Z and Q, reassigning 2 previous letter assignments for 12 layouts without the letter U in any corner and incorporating 6 unused letters (among the eight in bold below), after substituting in the results above:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, C, U, M, F, P, **G, W, Y, B, V, K, X, J**, Q, Z

       Hand 1:          Hand 2:
     1  x  x  4        13 x  x 16
     x  x  x  x        x  x  x  x
     9  x  x 12        21 x  x 24   
     
Since there are 8! = 40,320 possible combinations for 12 layouts and 7! = 5,040 possible combinations for 36 layouts, we need to score and evaluate an additional 665,280 layouts.
    
#### Further optimize layouts by exchanging more letters

If we relax the above fixed initializations and permit further exchange of letters, then we can search for even higher-scoring layouts. As a final optimization step we exchange letters, 8 keys at a time (8! = 40,320) selected in 24 different ways, in each of the above 48 layouts, to score a total of 46,448,640 more combinations. We allow the following keys to exchange letters:

    1. Center of the top and bottom rows on both sides
    2. Top and bottom rows on the left side 
    3. Top and bottom rows on the right side
    4. Bottom rows
    5. Top rows
    6. Top left and bottom right rows 
    7. Top right and bottom left rows
    8. Left half of the top and bottom rows on both sides 
    9. Right half of the top and bottom rows on both sides
    10. Left half of non-home rows on the left and right half of the same rows on the right 
    11. Right half of non-home rows on the left and left half of the same rows on the right 
    12. The eight corners
    13. Repeat 1-12

After assigning letters Z and Q to upper right keys outside of the home blocks and testing left/right side swap of all letters, the top-scoring letter layout is:
    
    B Y O U  L D W V Z
    C I E A  H T S N Q
    G X J K  R M F P    
    
### Step 4: Stability Tests

We will run three stability tests on the winning layouts:
    
    1. Compare score of the winning layout after rearranging random letters 
    2. Compare ranking of all final layouts based on interkey speed
    3. Compare ranking of all final layouts after removing each scoring parameter

The first test is to see if rearranging random sets of eight of the 16 letters in non-home rows in every possible combination improves the score of the winning layout. We repeat this test 1,000 times. In the second test, we rescore all of the final layouts, replacing the factor matrix with either the flow matrix or the inter-key speed matrix to see if this affects their ranking. In the third test we remove each Engram scoring parameter one at a time and rescore all of the final layouts to see if this affects their ranking.

For test 1, the top-scoring layout remains unchanged, attesting to its stability. For test 2, no other layout consistently beats the top layout after these replacements. For test 3, the top-scored layout remains at the top, attesting to its robustness to parameter perturbations. These tests support the choice of the top-scoring layout as the winner.

### Step 5. Arrange non-letter characters in easy-to-remember places

Now that we have all 26 letters accounted for, we turn our attention to non-letter characters, taking into account frequency of punctuation and ease of recall.

### Add punctuation keys and number keys

We will assign the most frequent punctuation according to Sun, et al (2018) to the six keys in the middle two columns:  . , " ' - ? ; : () ! _

            B Y O U   '  "   L D W V Z
            C I E A   ,  .   H T S N Q
            G X J K   -  ?   R M F P

We will use the Shift key to group similar punctuation marks (separating and joining marks in the left middle column and closing marks in the right middle column):

            B Y O U  '(  ")  L D W V Z #$ @`
            C I E A  ,;  .:  H T S N Q
            G X J K  -_  ?!  R M F P

**Separating marks (left)**: The comma separates text in lists; the semicolon can be used in place of the comma to separate items in a list (especially if these items contain commas); open parenthesis sets off an explanatory word, phrase, or sentence. 

**Joining marks (left)**: The apostrophe joins words as contractions; the hyphen joins words as compounds; the underscore joins words in cases where whitespace characters are not permitted (such as in variables or file names). 

**Closing marks (right)**: A sentence usually ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. The colon ends one statement but precedes the following: an explanation, quotation, list, etc. Double quotes and close parenthesis closes a word, clause, or sentence separated by an open parenthesis.

**Number keys**: 
The numbers are flanked to the left and right by [square brackets], and {curly brackets} accessed by the Shift key. Each of the numbers is paired with a mathematical or logic symbol accessed by the Shift key:
    
    { | = ~ +   <  >   ^ & % * } \
    [ 1 2 3 4   5  6   7 8 9 0 ] /

    1: | (vertical bar or "pipe" represents the logical OR operator: 1 stroke, looks like the number one)
    2: = (equal: 2 strokes, like the Chinese character for "2")
    3: ~ (tilde: "almost equal", often written with 3 strokes, like the Chinese character for "3")
    4: + (plus: has four quadrants; resembles "4")
    5 & 6: < > ("less/greater than"; these angle brackets are directly above the other bracket keys)
    7: ^ (caret for logical XOR operator as well as exponentiation; resembles "7")
    8: & (ampersand: logical AND operator; resembles "8")
    9: % (percent: related to division; resembles "9")
    0: * (asterisk: for multiplication; resembles "0") 

The three remaining keys in many common keyboards (flanking the upper right hand corner Backspace key) are displaced in special keyboards, such as the Kinesis Advantage and Ergodox. For the top right key, we will assign the forward slash and backslash: / \\. For the remaining two keys, we will assign two symbols that in modern usage have significance in social media: the hash/pound sign and the "at sign". The hash or hashtag identifies digital content on a specific topic (the Shift key accesses the dollar sign). The "at sign" identifies a location or affiliation (such as in email addresses) and acts as a "handle" to identify users in popular social media platforms and online forums.

The resulting Engram layout:

         [{ 1| 2= 3~ 4+  5<  6>  7^ 8& 9% 0* ]} /\
            bB yY oO uU  '(  ")  lL dD wW vV zZ #$ @`
            cC iI eE aA  ,;  .:  hH tT sS nN qQ
            gG xX jJ kK  -_  ?!  rR mM fF pP
